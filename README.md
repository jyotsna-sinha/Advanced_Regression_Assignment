# Advanced Regression Assignment
> A US based company is looking at prospective properties to buy  at Australia to enter their market. They need a regression model using regularisation 
in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

Essentially, the company wants to understand â€”
- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
- How well those variables describe the price of a house.
**So interpretation is important!**
